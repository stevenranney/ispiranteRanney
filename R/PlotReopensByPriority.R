  ##details<< This functions converts values that are \code{nan.0} to \code{NA}.
  
  ##details<< Priority levels in some of the sample data are represented by five 
  ## different values: \code{High}, \code{Low}, \code{Normal}, \code{Urgent}, 
  ## and \code{-}. Review of the sample data showed that the \code{-} priority 
  ## level could not be determined to match any other level.
    
  ##details<< Boxes in the plot that is produced from this function can help
  ## managers understand the number of reopens by \code{priority} level.  If the 
  ## notches in a box overlap the heavy bar (i.e., the median number of reopens)
  ## in an adjacent box, then the number of reopens for that priority level is \emph{not}
  ## significantly different than the number of reopens in the adjacent box.  This 
  ## provides a quick, easy method of determining if \code{priority} level really 
  ## has an affect on the number of reopens.
    
  ##details<< The red dots on a plot indicate outliers in the data set.  In the 
  ## \code{\link{geom_boxplot}} documentation, outliers are defined as data points 
  ## fall outside of \emph{1.5 * IQR} where \emph{IQR} stands for the "Inter-Quartile
  ## Range" of the data.
